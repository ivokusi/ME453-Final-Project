    "Ultrasonic welding has become important in the advent of technologies where lightweight innovations are rising. These can be related but are not limited to the automobile, aviation, and in general transport industries. Composite joints can be made up of different materials, plastic, paper, stainless steel, aluminum to produce high-end quality lightweight parts. Ultrasonic welding is an industry preferred process thanks to its fast welding time to connect components into a solid state. The ultrasonic welding process is a projected type technique of binding : The process needs a vertical force that makes contact with the components through a horn. These components are placed in an anvil and oscillet at high frequencies in the kHz. The energy used and other parameters are dependent on the material being welded. In this project the following will be analyzed: ...."
